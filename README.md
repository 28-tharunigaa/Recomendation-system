# Recommendation System

## Overview
This is a simple recommendation system that suggests items such as movies, books, or products to users based on their preferences. The system uses techniques like collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to generate personalized recommendations.

## Features
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends items based on item attributes and user preferences.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests items by analyzing user interactions and identifying similar users.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both filtering techniques for better accuracy.
- **Scalability**: Can handle large datasets and evolving user preferences.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different types of recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data processing)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning algorithms)
- **Surprise** (for collaborative filtering)
- **Flask/Django** (for web deployment, if applicable)
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL** (for storing user preferences and interactions)

## Usage
### Running the Recommendation System
To generate recommendations via a script
python recommend.py
```
To start a web-based interface using Flask:
python app.py
```

### Example
If a user likes science fiction movies, the system will recommend similar movies based on attributes (content-based filtering) or suggest movies that other similar users liked (collaborative filtering).

## Customization
- Modify `data.csv` or `database.db` to add custom user-item interactions.
- Adjust recommendation algorithms for better performance.
- Extend the system to support real-time recommendations.
